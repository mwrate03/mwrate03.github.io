        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The first thing I noticed when interacting with the experience was the
        vibrant colour scheme and playful interactive designs. It perfectly
        encapsulates what to expect from Palat in terms of his design style and
        skills. The combination of fun fonts, bright contrasting colours, and
        cursor-responsive movements makes the overall experience engaging,
        dynamic, and satisfying to explore.

        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The part of the experience I spent the most time engaging with was the
        “pixel displacement effect” towards the end of the website. It was
        fascinating to see how the pixels moved and responded to the cursor’s
        movement. I found it both satisfying to interact with and intriguing
        from a technical perspective, making me curious about how it was
        programmed.

      <h2>
        4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most common action in my two-minute interaction was moving my cursor
        around the website to engage with its elements. Each section involved
        using my cursor to explore different interactions, from switching
        between colours, words, and fonts in the first section to experiencing
        the pixel displacement effect.
      </p>

      <h2>
        5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I assume the primary goal of the interactive experience was to showcase
        the designer's website development skills, as well as their colourful
        and creative personality through the vibrant colour scheme and engaging
        interactive elements. The intention seems to be to stand out from
        typical portfolios, which often simply list past work, by instead
        creating an interactive experience that directly demonstrates their
        talent, skills, and unique creativity.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>
        6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The interactive experience communicates this primary goal by immersing
        users in a dynamic and engaging interface that directly showcases the
        designer’s technical skills and creative style. Instead of simply
        displaying a portfolio, the website itself becomes a demonstration of
        their abilities through the interactive elements, playful aesthetic and
        a hands-on design encouraging users to experiment with the different
        elements. By integrating design and interactivity, the experience
        effectively showcases both technical proficiency and artistic vision in
        a way that words alone wouldn’t convey.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>
        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h2>
      <p>
        The experience seems designed for short yet engaging interactions,
        encouraging users to explore its interactive elements in a single
        session rather than requiring repeated visits. Given its playful and
        experimental nature, users are likely to spend a few minutes navigating
        through different sections, testing out effects, and enjoying the
        dynamic responses to their cursor movements. However, the experience
        could also invite multiple visits from those interested in his web
        design, as they may return to analyse specific effects or contact him
        for potential work. Overall, it feels best suited for brief but
        impactful engagement, where users can fully appreciate the creativity
        and technical execution in a single interaction, with the potential for
        occasional revisits out of interest in his work.

      <h2>
        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The interactive experience communicates how it should be engaged with
        over time through its responsive design. The immediate interactive
        feedback encourages short but immersive exploration, guiding users to
        experiment freely without a fixed pathway. Its dynamic elements provide
        instant gratification, making it feel like a one-time experience that
        leaves a lasting impression rather than something that requires repeated
        visits.
      </p>

      <h2>
        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The experience references interactive web design, digital art, and UI/UX
        design. Its cursor-responsive effects and dynamic visuals are
        reminiscent of video games and creative coding projects. Additionally,
        the bold colours, typography, and animations draw from modern graphic
        design and motion graphics, commonly seen in branding and digital
        marketing.
      </p>

      <h2>
        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The references suggest that Palat designed the engagement to be playful
        and exploratory rather than passive. The interactive elements encourage
        curiosity, experimentation, and direct interaction, similar to how users
        navigate video games or digital art installations. This implies that the
        experience is meant to be discovered through action rather than just
        observation.

      <h2>
        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The vibrant visuals, playful animations, and interactive elements create
        a sense of excitement and curiosity. The experience feels fun,
        encouraging users to enjoy the process of exploration. It conveys a
        sense of creativity and innovation, making the interaction feel fresh
        and dynamic.

      <h2>
        12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most frustrating part of the interaction is that some of the
        interactive elements are unclear or lack guidance, making it difficult
        to understand how they work.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>
        13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most satisfying part is the pixel displacement effect, as it reacts
        fluidly to cursor movement and provides a visually pleasing response.
        The immediate feedback and smooth motion make it fun to interact with,
        creating a sense of control and engagement that enhances the overall
        experience.
